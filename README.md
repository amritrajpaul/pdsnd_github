### Date created
26th of August 2020

### Project Title
Data_Analysis_program(upon Bikeshare data)

### Description
We make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC.It answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
Input will be like -
 
Enter the City to analyse about as:
'1' for chicago,
'2' for new york city,
'3' for washington

Enter the month of chicago city to analyse about as:
'1' for all,
'2' for january,
'3' for february,
'4' for march,
'5' for april,
'6' for may,
'7' for june,

Enter the day of all of chicago city to analyse about as:
'1' for all,
'2' for monday,
'3' for tuesday,

'5' for thursday,
'6' for friday,
'7' for saturday,
