Data_Analysis_program(upon Bikeshare data)

### Description
We make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC.It answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
